# jpmc-coding-exam

## Purpose
To demonstrate relevant software engineering skills by creating a REST API in my development style.

## Evaluation observations
### Preface
I appreciate the time spent to evaluate this submission. Let me start by saying this application
could have been made as a single file instead of as an entire project. However, a lot of the 'niceties' would have been lost.
The main advantages of my development style include (but are not limited to) the following:
1) high modularity
2) low coupling & high cohesion
3) low downtime for project inheritance, development setup, and deployment
### Features
So what does this come with? Plenty. Everything below contributes to one or more of the above-mentioned advantages.   
-clear folder structure, good package management  
-logging, error handling  
-enumerations, route management, configurations   
-virtual environment, dependency management, environment management   
-processes for building, testing, and deploying   
-ability to run either locally, in docker, or in kubernetes   
-documentation    
-version control    
### Postface
Due to the richness of this project, I am more than happy to discuss, expand on, and demonstrate everything I 
have written with an in-person interview.
